# Media communication

WebRTC uses RTP and RTCP for media communication.

## 1. RTP

The Real-time Transport Protocol(RTP) is a network protocol used to deliver streaming audio and video media over the internet.

## 2. RTCP

RTCP stands for Real-time Transport Control Protocol. RTCP works hand in hand with RTP. RTP does the delivery of the actual data, whereas RTCP is used to send control packets to participants in a call. The primary function is to provide feedback on the quality of service being provided by RTP.
