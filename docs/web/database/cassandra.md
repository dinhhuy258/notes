# Cassandra

## 1. Cassandra Architecture

Some of the features of Cassandra architecture are as follows:

- Cassandra is designed such that it has no master or slave nodes.
- It has a ring-type architecture, that is, its nodes are logically distributed like a ring.
- Data is automatically distributed across all the nodes.
- Similar to HDFS, data is replicated across the nodes for redundancy.
- Data is kept in memory and lazily written to the disk.
- Hash values of the keys are used to distribute the data among nodes in the cluster.

Additional features of Cassandra architecture are:

- Cassandra architecture supports multiple data centers.
- Data can be replicated across data centers.

You can keep three copies of data in one data center and the fourth copy in a remote data center for remote backup. Data reads prefer a local data center to a remote data center.

### Node

Node is the place where data is stored. It is the basic component of Cassandra.

### Rack

A rack is a group of machines housed in the same physical box.

- All machines in the rack are connected to the network switch of the rack
- The rackâ€™s network switch is connected to the cluster.
- All machines on the rack have a common power supply. It is important to notice that a rack can fail due to two reasons: a network switch failure or a power supply failure.
- If a rack fails, none of the machines on the rack can be accessed. So it would seem as though all the nodes on the rack are down.

### Datacenter

A datacenter is a logical set of racks/ nodes. A common use case is AWS-EAST vs AWS-WEST...

### Cluster

The cluster is the collection of many data centers.

## 2. Data distribution and replication

### 2.1 Data Partitions

A **partition key** is converted to a **token** by a **partitioner**. The tokens are signed integer values between -2^63 to +2^63-1, and this range is referred to as token range.

If we consider there are only 100 tokens used for a Cassandra cluster with three nodes. Each node is assigned approximately 33 tokens like

```
node1: 0-33
node2: 34-66
node3: 67-99
```

If there are nodes added or removed, the token range distribution should be shuffled to suit the new topology. This process takes a lot of calculation and configuration change for each cluster operation.

If one node is removed, data in removed node is placed on the next neighbor node in clockwise manner.

### 2.2 Virtual nodes/Vnodes

Virtual nodes in a Cassandra cluster are also called vnodes. Vnodes can be defined for each physical node in the cluster. Each node in the ring can hold multiple virtual nodes.

The default number of Vnodes owned by a node in Cassandra is `256`, which is set by  `num_tokens` property. When a node is added into a cluster, the token allocation algorithm allocates tokens to the node. The algorithm selects random token values to ensure uniform distribution.

In your case you have 6 nodes, each set with 256 token ranges so you have 6*256 token ranges and each psychical node contains 256 token ranges.
