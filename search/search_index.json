In fact, this is essentially what Bitcask (the default storage engine in Riak) does. Bitcask offers high-performance reads and writes, subject to the requirement that all the keys fit in the available RAM, since the hash map is kept completely in memory.</p> <p>A storage engine like Bitcask is well suited to situations where the value for each key is updated frequently. For example, the key might be the URL of a cat video, and the value might be the number of times it has been played (incremented every time someone hits the play button).

Frozen log files can later be compacted (duplicate keys are removed and only the most recent value of a key is kept).</p> <p>Each segment now has its own in-memory hash table, mapping keys to file offsets. In order to find the value for a key, we first check the most recent segment\u2019s hash map; if the key is not present we check the second-most-recent segment, and so on.

Sort Key Attributes Any base table attribute of type string, number, or binary. Any base table attribute of type string, number, or binary. Key Values Do not need to be unique. The sort key value does not need to be unique for a given partition key value. Size Restrictions Per Partition Key Value No restriction. For each partition key value, the total size of all indexed items must be 10 GB or less. Index Operations Can be created during creation of a table. Can be created on an existing table. Can be deleted from an existing table. Can be created during creation of a table. Read Consistency for Queries Supports eventual consistency only from asynchronous updates and deletes. You can choose either eventual consistency or strong consistency. Provisioned Throughput Consumption Every global secondary index has its own provisioned throughput settings for read and write activity that you need to specify. Queries or scans on a global secondary index consume capacity units from the index, not from the base table. This is also case for global secondary index updates due to table writes. Queries or scans on a local secondary index consume read capacity units from the base table. When you write to a table, and its local secondary indexes are updated, these updates consume write capacity units from the base table. Projected Attributes With global secondary queries or scans, you can only request attributes that are projected into this index. If you query or scan a local secondary index, you can request attributes that are not projected into the index. DynamoDB will automatically fetch those attributes from the table.

The columns of a table in Postgres are separated into groups called heap pages. We can picture our table being composed of several pages as shown in the following diagram:</p> <p></p> <p>When we create an index on a column, Postgres can, in general, very efficiently figure out the pages where the rows resulting from a query are located. It can also tell their position within the pages.</p> <p>Using an <code>Index Scan</code> with a b-tree, for each row in the result Postgres will ask the b-tree for the heap page and row location on the page, load the heap page and then retrieve the row.</p> <p>Heap pages are stored in disk and thus loading a page in memory is costly. Thus, when using <code>Index Scan</code>, if the query results in a lot of rows, the query might become very slow because an Index Scan will make a page load for each row in the result.</p> <p>The following diagram shows a scenario where the query results in four rows (show in color) located in three different pages. Each color represents a consecutive group of rows that belong to the result of the query. Using an <code>Index Scan</code> Postgres will load pages 2 and 7 once and page 5 twice.</p> <p></p> <p>Note: Random access is also the main problem causing slow performance in <code>Index Scan</code> when it returns multiple rows.</p> <p>Consider the following plan:</p> <pre><code>EXPLAIN\nSELECT * FROM bookings WHERE total_amount = 48500.00;\n\n   QUERY PLAN\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\n Bitmap Heap Scan on bookings  (cost=54.63..7040.42 rows=2865 wid...\n   Recheck Cond: (total_amount = 48500.00)\n   \u2212&gt; Bitmap Index Scan on bookings_total_amount_idx\n       (cost=0.00..53.92 rows=2865 width=0)\n       Index Cond: (total_amount = 48500.00)\n(5 rows)\n</code></pre> <p>The query plan that we obtained above shows an alternative strategy where first, Postgres uses the index to figure out the heap pages that contain results.

The disadvantage is that each of those pages will be fully read, meaning that Postgres will inspect some rows that do not belong to the result.</p> <p>We can thus summarize the scans as follows:</p> <ul> <li>Bitmap Index Scan: Identify all heap pages that contain results that match the query</li> <li>Bitmap Heap Scan: Scan each heap page fully and recheck conditions</li> </ul> <p>The whole bitmap is a single bit array, with as many bits as there are heap pages in the relation being scanned.</p> <p>Bitmap starting off with all entries 0 (false). Whenever an index entry that matches the search condition is found, the heap address pointed to by that index entry is looked up as an offset into the bitmap, and that bit is set to 1 (true). So rather than looking up the heap page directly, the bitmap index scan looks up the corresponding bit position in the bitmap.</p> <p>Then the bitmap contains information for heap pages we need to bother to load and examine.</p> <p>Since each heap page might contain multiple rows, we then have to examine each row to see if it matches all the conditions - that's what the <code>Recheck Cond</code> part is about.</p>"},{"location":"database/postgres/bitmap_index_scan/#bitmap-operations","title":"Bitmap operations","text":"<p>A query may include multiple fields in its filter conditions.

Let\u2019s explore the Routing Policies that are provided by Route 53.</p> <p>Simple routing policy</p> <p>The Simple Routing Policy is used for a single resource that performs a specific function for your domain. For example, you might use it to route traffic to an Amazon EC2 instance serving content for the <code>example.com</code> website.</p> <p>With this policy, you can configure multiple values (such as multiple IP addresses or endpoints). When multiple values are configured, Route 53 will randomly choose one to route traffic to.</p> <p>Note that the Simple Routing Policy cannot be used in conjunction with Health Checks.</p> <p></p> <p>Failover routing policy</p> <p>The Failover Routing Policy is designed to provide high availability by routing traffic to a backup resource when the primary resource becomes unavailable. It allows users to define a primary resource and a standby (failover) resource, along with health checks to monitor the availability of each resource.</p> <p>When Route 53 detects that the primary resource is unhealthy, it automatically directs traffic to the failover resource, ensuring seamless failover in case of resource failures or disruptions.</p> <p></p> <p>Weighted routing policy</p> <p>Weighted routing policy enables users to control the distribution of traffic among multiple resources by assigning weights to each resource. This allows you to assign weights to resource record sets. For instance, you can specify <code>25</code> for one resource and <code>75</code> for another, meaning that <code>25%</code> of requests will go to the first resource and <code>75%</code> will be routed to the second.</p> <p></p> <p>Latency routing policy</p> <p>Latency Routing Policy routes traffic to the resource with the lowest latency for the user, ensuring optimal performance and minimal response times.</p> <p></p> <p>This policy best suits latency-sensitive applications such as online gaming platforms, video streaming services, or real-time communication applications, where minimizing latency is essential for user satisfaction.</p> <p>Geolocation routing policy</p> <p>Geolocation routing policy directs traffic based on the user\u2019s geographic location, ensuring that users are routed to the nearest available resource or a resource optimized for their region.</p> <p></p> <p>This policy best suits content delivery networks (CDNs), regional applications, or services with data sovereignty requirements, where serving content from geographically closer servers is essential.</p> <p>Multivalue routing policy</p> <p>Multivalue Routing Policy combines elements of simple routing and failover routing to improve availability and fault tolerance. With multivalue routing, users can create multiple records with the same name, each associated with its health check. When a user queries a domain, up to eight healthy records are returned, while unhealthy ones are excluded. If more than eight healthy records exist, they are returned randomly.</p> <p></p> <p>IP-based routing policy</p> <p>IP-based routing policy directs traffic based on the IP address of the requesting device or DNS resolver. It allows users to define routing rules based on IP addresses or ranges, ensuring that requests from specific devices or networks are directed to designated resources.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"devops/aws/s3/","title":"Amazon S3","text":"<p>Amazon S3 or Amazon Simple Storage Service is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface.</p>"},{"location":"devops/aws/s3/#buckets-and-objects","title":"Buckets and Objects","text":"<p>Amazon S3 allows people to store objects (files) in buckets (directories).

In this process, the consumers query the queue, whenever they are available, in order to receive messages from the queue. Amazon SQS supports short and long polling. These models provide different trade-offs in terms of latency, throughput, and cost, allowing us to choose the model that best fits our application\u2019s requirements.</p> <p>Short polling</p> <p>In this method, only a subset of the servers (based on a weighted random distribution) are queried when the SQS queue receives a message retrieval request. SQS sends an empty response immediately, in case it doesn\u2019t find any messages in the queue. Due to this, there is a chance we might not receive messages using short polling. However, if our queue contains less than 1000 messages, we\u2019ll be able to receive these messages with short polling. Also, if we keep sending message retrieval requests to our queue, all available servers are queried to send back a response.</p> <p></p> <p>In the above diagram, only the <code>S1</code>, <code>S3</code>, and <code>S5</code> servers are queried during short polling.

We can also reduce the false empty responses by querying all servers rather than a subset of servers Since we are charged on every polling request made to the SQS queue, long polling is preferred to reduce cost by reducing the number of empty responses received. However, it is not beneficial to use long polling in case our application expects an immediate response from the SQS queue.

Different Ingress controllers support different annotations.</p> <p>Explain <code>rewrite-target</code> annotation. For example we have 2 services:</p> <ol> <li><code>watch</code> app at <code>http://&lt;watch-service&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code></li> <li><code>wear</code> app at <code>http://&lt;wear-service&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/</code></li> </ol> <p>We must configure Ingress to achieve the below:</p> <ul> <li>http://:/watch \u2013&gt; http://:/ <li>http://:/wear \u2013&gt; http://:/ <p>Without the <code>rewrite-target</code> option, this is what would happen:</p> <ul> <li>http://:/watch \u2013&gt; http://:/watch <li>http://:/wear \u2013&gt; http://:/wear <p>Notice <code>watch</code> and <code>wear</code> at the end of the target URLs. The target applications are not configured with <code>/watch</code> or <code>/wear</code> paths. They are different applications built specifically for their purpose, so they don\u2019t expect <code>/watch</code> or <code>/wear</code> in the URLs</p> <p>To fix that we want to ReWrite the URL when the request is passed on to the <code>watch</code> or <code>wear</code> applications. We don\u2019t want to pass in the same path that user typed in. So we specify the <code>rewrite-target</code> option. This rewrites the URL by replacing whatever is under <code>rules-&gt;http-&gt;paths-&gt;path</code> with the value in <code>rewrite-target</code>. This works just like a search and replace function.</p> <p>For example: replace(path, rewrite-target)</p> <p>In our case: replace(\"/testpath\",\"/\")</p> <p>Ingress rules</p> <p>Each HTTP each contains the following information:</p> <ul> <li>An optional host.

Both the host and path must match the content of an incomming request before the load balancer directs traffic to the referenced Service.</li> </ul> <p>Ingress path types</p> <p>Each path in Ingress is required to have a corresponding path type. There are three supported path types:</p> <ul> <li><code>ImplementationSpecific</code>: With this path type, matching is up to the IngressClass. Implementation can treat this as a separate <code>pathType</code> or treat it identically to <code>Prefix</code> or <code>Exact</code> path types.</li> <li><code>Exact</code>: Match the URL path exactly and with case sensitive.</li> <li><code>Prefix</code>: Match based on a URL path prefix split by <code>/</code></li> </ul> <p>Note: If the last element of the path is a substring of the last element in the request path, it is not match (Eg: <code>/foo/bar</code> matches <code>/foo/bar/baz</code> but does not match <code>/foo/barbaz</code>)</p> <p>TLS</p> <p>You can secure an Ingress by specifying a Secret that contains a TLS private key an certificate.</p> <p>Eg:</p> <pre><code>apiVersion: v1\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  name: testsecret-tls\n  namespace: default\ndata:\n  tls.crt: base64 encoded cert\n  tls.key: base64 encoded key\ntype: kubernetes.io/tls\n</code></pre> <pre><code>apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: tls-example-ingress\nspec:\n  tls:\n  - hosts:\n      - https-example.foo.com\n    secretName: testsecret-tls\n  rules:\n  - host: https-example.foo.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n   apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nkind: Ingress\nmetadata:\n  name: tls-example-ingress\nspec:\n  tls:\n  - hosts:\n      - https-example.foo.com\n    secretName: testsecret-tls\n  rules:\n  - host: https-example.foo.com\n    http:\n      paths:\n      - path: /\n        pathType: Prefix\n        backend:\n          service:\n            name: service1\n            port:\n              number: 80\n         name: service1\n            port:\n              number: 80\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"devops/kubernetes/ingress/#kubernetes-ingress-controller","title":"Kubernetes Ingress Controller","text":"<p>An ingress controller is typically a reverse web proxy server implementation in the cluster.

The idea is that you define the Terraform code for your infrastructure just once, in a single repo, called, for example, modules:</p> <pre><code>\u2514\u2500\u2500 modules\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 app\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 mysql\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.tf\n</code></pre> <p>This repo contains typical Terraform code, with one difference: anything in your code that should be different between environments should be exposed as an input variable. For example, the app module might expose the following variables:</p> <pre><code>variable \"instance_count\" {\n  description = \"How many servers to run\"\n}\n\nvariable \"instance_type\" {\n  description = \"What kind of servers to run (e.g. t2.large)\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>In a separate repo, called, for example, live, you define the code for all of your environments, which now consists of just one terragrunt.hcl file per component (e.g. app/terragrunt.hcl, mysql/terragrunt.hcl, etc). This gives you the following file layout:</p> <pre><code>\u2514\u2500\u2500 live\n    \u251c\u2500\u2500 prod\n    \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 app\n    \u2502   \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 terragrunt.hcl\n    \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 mysql\n    \u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 terragrunt.hcl\n    \u2514\u2500\u2500 stage\n        \u251c\u2500\u2500 app\n        \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 terragrunt.hcl\n        \u2514\u2500\u2500 mysql\n            \u2514\u2500\u2500 terragrunt.hcl\n</code></pre> <p>For example, stage/app/terragrunt.hcl may look like this:</p> <pre><code>terraform {\n  # Deploy version v0.0.3 in stage\n  source = \"git::git@github.com:foo/modules.git//app?ref=v0.0.3\"\n}\n\ninputs = {\n  instance_count = 3\n  instance_type  = \"t2.micro\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>DRY common Terraform code with Terragrunt generate blocks</p> <p>Terragrunt has the ability to generate code in to the downloaded remote Terraform modules before calling out to terraform using the generate block. This can be used to inject common terraform configurations into all the modules that you use.</p> <pre><code>generate \"providers\" {\n  path      = \"providers.tf\"\n  if_exists = \"overwrite\"\n  contents  = &lt;&lt;EOF\nterraform {\n\n  required_providers {\n    aws = {\n      source  = \"hashicorp/aws\"\n      version = \"~&gt; ${local.aws_provider_version}\"\n    }\n  }\n\n  backend \"s3\" {}\n}\nEOF\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This instructs Terragrunt to create the file <code>provider.tf</code> in the working directory (where Terragrunt calls terraform) before it calls any of the Terraform commands (e.g <code>plan</code>, <code>apply</code>, <code>validate</code>, etc). This allows you to inject this provider configuration in all the modules that includes the root file.</p> <p>To include this in the child configurations (e.g mysql/terragrunt.hcl), you would update all the child modules to include this configuration using the include block:</p> <pre><code>include \"root\" {\n  path = find_in_parent_folders()\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Create remote state and locking resources automatically</p> <p>The generate block is useful for allowing you to setup the remote state backend configuration in a DRY manner, but this introduces a bootstrapping problem: how do you create and manage the underlying storage resources for the remote state? For example, when using the s3 backend, Terraform expects the S3 bucket to already exist for it to upload the state objects.</p> <p>Ideally you can manage the S3 bucket using Terraform, but what about the state object for the module managing the S3 bucket? How do you create the S3 bucket, before you run terraform, if you need to run terraform to create the bucket?</p> <p>To handle this, Terragrunt supports a different block for managing the backend configuration: the remote_state block.</p> <pre><code>remote_state {\n  backend = \"s3\"\n  generate = {\n    path      = \"backend.tf\"\n    if_exists = \"overwrite\"\n  }\n  config = {\n    bucket         = \"my-terraform-state\"\n    key            = \"${path_relative_to_include()}/terraform.tfstate\"\n    region         = \"us-east-1\"\n    encrypt        = true\n    dynamodb_table = \"my-lock-table\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Like the approach with <code>generate</code> blocks, this will generate a <code>backend.tf</code> file that contains the remote state configuration. However, in addition to that, terragrunt will also now manage the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for you. This means that if the S3 bucket <code>my-terraform-state</code> and DynamoDB table <code>my-lock-table</code> does not exist in your account, Terragrunt will automatically create these resources before calling terraform and configure them based on the specified configuration parameters.</p>"},{"location":"distributed-system/api_gateway/","title":"API Gateway","text":"<p>An API gateway is a service which is the entry point into the application from the outside world and acts as a single point of entry for a defined group of microservices.</p> <p>In high level It\u2019s responsible for request routing, API composition, and other functions, such as authentication.</p> <p>Functionalities of API Gateway:</p> <ul> <li>Authentication and authorization</li> <li>Load balancing</li> <li>Service discovery integration</li> <li>Protocol translation</li> <li>Response caching</li> <li>Retry policies, circuit breaker, and QoS</li> <li>Rate limiting and throttling</li> <li>Logging, tracing, correlation</li> <li>Headers, query strings, and claims transformation</li> <li>IP whitelisting</li> <li>IAM</li> <li>Centralized Logging (transaction ID across the servers, error logging)</li> <li>Identity Provider, Authentication and Authorization</li> </ul> <p>List of notable API Gateways:</p> <ul> <li>Zuul</li> <li>Amazon API Gateway</li> <li>Kong Gateway</li> </ul>"},{"location":"distributed-system/api_gateway/#benefits-of-api-gateways","title":"Benefits of API gateways","text":"<ul> <li>Decoupling: If your clients which you have no control over communicated directly with many separate services, renaming or moving those services can be challenging as the client is coupled to the underlying architecture and organization.

This distribution can help preven any single path from becoming a bottleneck.</li> <li>Redundancy: By having multiple paths available, ECMP enhances the network\u2019s ability to remain operational even if one or more paths fail.</li> <li>Scalability: As network demands grow, ECMP can handle increased traffic by simply adding more paths without needing significant changes to the network\u2019s core architecture.</li> </ul> <p>In a network with multiple paths to a destination, without ECMP, only one path is selected, leaving the other paths unused. This leads to all traffic being routed through a single path, causing bottlenecks and offering no redundancy if the path fails. After applying ECMP, traffic is evenly distributed across all equal-cost paths, reducing congestion and ensuring that if one path fails, the other paths can still carry the traffic, providing both better performance and fault tolerance.</p> <p>How ECMP works</p> <p>When traffic arrives at the router, the router applies a hashing algorithm to various fields in the packet (such as source/destination IP, source/destination port, etc.) to determine which of the available equal-cost paths to use. This ensures that packets belonging to the same flow (e.g., a TCP session) always take the same path to avoid out-of-order delivery, while different flows may take different paths. This load-balancing mechanism enhances bandwidth utilization and provides redundancy, ensuring that the network can continue operating efficiently even if one path fails.</p> <p>ECMP typically uses a hashing algorithm to determine the path for each flow, but other algorithms like round-robin, per-packet load balancing, or weighted round-robin can also be used to distribute traffic across multiple paths, depending on the network configuration. These algorithms offer different methods for balancing the load and managing traffic flows in the network.</p>"},{"location":"networking/home_network/setup_ecmp_on_mikrotik_router/#setup-ecmp","title":"Setup ECMP","text":""},{"location":"networking/home_network/setup_ecmp_on_mikrotik_router/#1-update-ip-hash-policy","title":"1.

If a client suspects that the token is stolen, then they can logout from the browser.
